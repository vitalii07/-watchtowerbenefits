         <p>Things to know</p>
         <p>&#159; This proposal shows a summary of proposed benefits, rates, and underlying assumptions. It is not part of 
            the group policy or a legal contract with Sun Life Financial or its affiliated companies.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; This proposal is valid for 60 days, starting from November 4, 2014, and only for the proposed Effective 
            Date. 
         </p>
         <p>&#159; This proposal is for fully insured, nonparticipating coverage that terminates at retirement, unless 
            otherwise noted.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; The rates shown may be subject to recalculation pending a) final enrollment, b) census data, and c) 
            review of any additional data requested in the proposal. Please review the assumptions for information 
            about how the rates were derived.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; We require that you provide a copy of the current carrier&rsquo;s policy or certificate at time of sale.</p>

         <p>Producer licensing</p>
         <p>All Sun Life Financial companies require producers who use insurance quotes for the purpose of soliciting, 
            selling or negotiating insurance to be licensed both by the state where the prospective client is located 
            and by any state where the solicitation, sale, or negotiation of insurance occurs, if different. This 
            requirement pertains to all forms of solicitation, sale, or negotiation of insurance, including but not limited
            to solicitation, sale, or negotiation conducted in person, or by telephone, by e-mail, by fax, or otherwise.
         </p>
         <p>Producer compensation</p>
         <p>We encourage brokers and their clients to discuss what commission or other compensation may be paid in 
            connection with the purchase of products and services from Sun Life companies. All Sun Life Financial 
            companies may pay the selling broker, agency, or third party administrator for the promotion, sale, and 
            renewal of the products and services offered in this proposal. In addition to our standard compensation 
            arrangements, we may make additional cash payments or reimbursements to selling brokers in recognition 
            of their marketing and distribution activities, persistency levels, and volume of business. For New York&ndash;
            issued cases, producers must comply with the specific compensation disclosure requirements of New York 
            Regulation 194.
         </p>
         <p>Plan and rates</p>
         <p>This proposal may be based on employee census information provided by the employer. Acceptance of the 
            group and final rates will be determined by Sun Life based on actual enrollment and case experience, if 
            required. Terms and conditions of any coverage under the policy may be determined by all required final 
            data and by underwriting rules, minimum participation requirements, and policy provisions in effect on the 
            date coverage begins.
         </p>
         <p>Underwriting companies</p>
         <p>The Sun Life Financial group of companies operates under the Sun Life Financial name. In the United States 
            and elsewhere, insurance products are offered by members of the Sun Life Financial group that are 
            insurance companies. Sun Life Financial Inc., the publicly traded holding company for the Sun Life Financial 
            group of companies, is not an insurance company and does not guarantee the obligations of these 
            insurance companies. Each insurance company relies on its own financial strength and claims-paying ability.

         <p>SLPC 20013 rev. 06090613  GGOT-1288</p>
         <p>Basic Life</p>
         <p>We are pleased to offer Basic Life insurance to employers, with the benefits employees want. Here are 
            some highlights:
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Value-Added Services: Employers with noncontributory coverage can choose the Value-Added 
            Services package that best fits the needs of their employees. These noninsurance services are 
            included in the price of your Basic Life coverage.
         </p>
         <p>&ndash; Choice #1: Emergency Travel Assistance for employees and dependents traveling 100+ miles 
            from home, and Identity Theft Protection for employees. Services provided by Assist 
            America.4
         </p>
         <p>&ndash; Choice #2: Online Will Preparation for employees and spouses, and Claimant Support 
            Services for claimants and families who need professional grief, legal, or financial 
            counseling. Services are provided over the telephone by ComPsych&reg;.4
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Accelerated Benefits: Terminally ill employees may access a portion of their death benefit while 
            they are alive. 
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Waiver of Premium: Waiver benefits protect employees who are Totally Disabled, as defined by the 
            policy, and who meet age requirements. Employers can customize the elimination period or choose 
            no elimination period&mdash;a popular choice because it means easy tracking and immediate benefits for 
            eligible employees.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Claims Settlement: Beneficiaries may elect to receive either a complimentary interest-bearing 
            account or a lump-sum payment. Availability and coverage may vary by state.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Accidental Death &amp; Dismemberment (AD&amp;D): Protection for covered Accidental Death and covered 
            injuries such as Speech/Hearing, Loss of Limb, Loss of Use of a Limb Due to Quadriplegia, Paraplegia, 
            or Hemiplegia, and Thumb and Index finger&mdash;all with a standard 365-day loss period. Many optional 
            riders can be added, including Seat Belt, Air Bag, Helmet, Business Travel, Bereavement Counseling, 
            and Child and/or Spouse Education.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Voluntary benefits: Attractive programs provide the coverage employees want, with simple, flexible 
            plan designs and hassle-free enrollments.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Portability: In states that allow portability, groups receive it as a standard feature. So, when 
            coverage ends for reasons other than sickness, injury, retirement, or termination of the employer&rsquo;s 
            plan, employees can apply for a portable Term Life policy without Evidence of Insurability. 
            Availability may vary by state.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Continuation: Groups in states where Portability is not available may elect Continuation at point of 
            sale. Continuation allows employees, when their coverage ends, to continue their Group Term 
            coverage without Evidence of Insurability. They can continue this coverage as long as the group 
            policy is in force. This coverage is in addition to any state-mandated Continuation benefits.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Service Guarantees: We are pleased to offer a Life Service Guarantee, which covers the speed and 
            accuracy of our claims processing as well as how quickly we respond to our customers&rsquo; phone calls. 
            In addition, we include an overall satisfaction guarantee to ensure that our customers are 100% 
            satisfied with our service. These service guarantees are available to all 100% employer-paid and 
            partially employer-paid plans.

         <p>Short-Term Disability
            We are pleased to offer income replacement coverage with flexible plan designs and Return-to-Work 
            incentives to help employers manage costs. Here are some highlights:
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Flexible and fully insured plan designs: Employers appreciate our flexible Short-Term Disability plan 
            designs, which all include an "own occupation" definition and full maternity coverage. Employers 
            may select from a variety of options: W-2 preparation at no additional cost, employer FICA match, 
            varied benefit durations, and length of elimination periods. 
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Expert claims management: Using a team approach, medical, psychiatric, and vocational 
            professionals actively manage Short-Term Disability claims. Employers who buy both Short-Term 
            Disability and Long-Term Disability can take full advantage of our innovative early intervention 
            process and personalized Return-to-Work plans.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Tiered benefits: Employers can vary benefits payments over the duration of an employee&rsquo;s disability. </p>
         <p>&#159; Statutory plans: We offer statutory plans in New York, New Jersey, and Hawaii.</p>
         <p>&#159; Residual Disability Benefits: This option allows employees to satisfy the Elimination Period by 
            combining days of Total and Partial Disability.

         <p>&#159; Partial Disability Benefits: This option allows employees to receive up to 100% of their pre-
            disability earnings when working part-time, giving them extra motivation to get back to work as 
            quickly as possible.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Survivor Benefit: This option allows a survivor benefit to be payable in a lump sum to a surviving 
            spouse or eligible child, if an employee dies before the benefit duration ends, was disabled for at 
            least 14 consecutive days, and was eligible to receive Short-Term Disability benefits prior to death.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; First-Day Hospitalization: This option helps protect hospitalized employees by providing immediate 
            benefits with no Elimination Period.

         <p>&#159; Standard Sun Life Financial policy language is offered, including coverage options for leave of absence, 
            layoff, or termination.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; An employee must be Actively at Work on his/her effective date for coverage to become effective. If 
            an employee is not Actively at Work on his or her effective date, coverage will not become effective 
            until the employee is again Actively at Work.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; There is continuity of coverage from the prior carrier&rsquo;s plan subject to policy limitations.</p>
         <p>&#159; This plan does not replace the statutory disability plan in any state.</p>
         <p>&#159; Employees in states with statutory STD plans are covered by those statutory plans and that any STD 
            benefit payable will be offset by those statutory benefits. We reserve the right to re-rate if this 
            assumption proves incorrect.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Sun Life requires a final census before the point of sale and reserves the right to re-rate the proposal 
            upon verification of dates of birth, genders, salaries, and occupations.

         <p>&#159; Receipt of a copy of the prior carrier's policy or certificate at the point of sale.</p>
         <p>&#159; Common ownership of the business units.</p>
         <p>&#159; All noncontributory plan designs assume that the employer pays the entire premium and that all 
            benefits are fully taxable.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Notification of any employer-completed merger or acquisition.</p>
         <p>&#159; This proposal assumes there is no coverage currently inforce.</p>
         <p>&#159; A minimum of 10 employees is required at point of sale.  If the eligibility of this group drops below 10 
            employees this proposal is not valid.

         <p>Long-Term Disability
            We are pleased to offer income replacement benefits that take into consideration disability management 
            through cost-containment and rehabilitation. Here are some highlights:
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Retro Disability BenefitsSM: In states that allow it, this innovative feature gives extra benefits to 
            employees with serious LTD claims. It&rsquo;s designed to help employees who are continuously 
            hospitalized for 14 days or more at the onset of Total Disability and who complete the Elimination 
            Period. When we pay the first Total Disability benefit, we will retroactively pay that claimant his or 
            her LTD benefits from the first day the claimant was deemed Totally Disabled. This benefit is paid in 
            a lump sum amount, and there are no offsets.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Innovative Return-to-Work incentives:  </p>

            are payable. Our Return-to-Work incentive allows combined earnings of up to 100% during the 
            Return-to-Work period. 
         </p>

            rehabilitation program approved by Sun Life Financial receive an additional 10% benefit.

            specialists. We offer customized Return to Work plans; physical, recreational, and vocational 
            therapy; job search assistance; and financial assistance for worksite accommodations and other 
            expenses.

         <p>&#159; Integrated Waiver of Premium processing: When the LTD plan is offered in combination with our 
            Group Life coverage, we automatically start the claims review process for claimants. This service 
            helps make it easier for claimants to apply for Waiver of Premium benefits.

            Assumptions
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Standard Sun Life Financial contractual language is offered, including coverage for leave of absence, 
            layoff or termination.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; An employee must be Actively at Work on his/her effective date for coverage to become effective. If 
            an employee is not Actively at Work on his or her effective date, coverage will not become effective 
            until the employee is again Actively at Work.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Definition of Total Disability: If an employee is unable to perform the material and substantial duties of 
            the employee's own occupation, he or she is considered disabled. When the Own Occupation Period is 
            completed, an employee is still considered disabled when unable to perform the material and 
            substantial duties of any occupation for which he or she is reasonably qualified by education, training, or 
            experience.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Employees in states with statutory STD plans are covered by those statutory plans and that any LTD 
            benefit payable will be offset by those statutory benefits. We reserve the right to re-rate if this 
            assumption proves incorrect.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Sun Life requires a final census before the point of sale and reserves the right to re-rate the proposal 
            upon verification of dates of birth, genders, salaries, and occupations.

            employees this proposal is not valid.

         <p>SLPC 20013 rev. 06090613</p>
         <p>Group Dental
            We are pleased to offer comprehensive PPO plans and flexible features that can be easily paired to meet 
            your group&rsquo;s dental needs. Here are the highlights:
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Flexible plan designs: Employers can customize our Passive PPO, Active PPO, and/or  Maximum 
            Allowable Charge (MAC) plans to meet their needs.* Offer two plans for a Dual Select benefit. 
            Include optional features&mdash;like orthodontia coverage or an annual maximum rollover provision&mdash;for 
            a more robust offering. Adjust benefit waiting periods, deductibles, and some procedure types to 
            suit your employees and your bottom line.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Voluntary dental: Once a plan design is selected, employers can choose to offer the plan at 100% 
            employee paid for a truly voluntary plan. All voluntary plans are equipped with a voluntary 
            enrollment strategy to improve participation in the plan. Participation requirements apply.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Administrative Services Only (ASO) dental: Large groups that self-fund their dental plan and have 
            100+ employees can take advantage of our administrative services. With dental ASO, Sun Life 
            handles claims adjudication and payments for you with claims reimbursement on a weekly basis with 
            no pre-fund requirement or on a monthly basis with a pre-funded amount of one month&rsquo;s expected 
            claims&mdash;whichever works for you.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Alliance network: All Sun Life Dental plans come with the United Concordia&reg; Alliance network,**
            With strong provider penetration and quality assurance controls, it&rsquo;s easy for employees to receive 
            quality dental care from a network dentist near home or work.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Encouraging good oral health: We know oral health leads to overall health. That&rsquo;s why we offer 
            built-in incentives to encourage preventive care, such as an extra cleaning during pregnancy on all 
            our plans and not counting preventive or Type I expenses toward the plan maximum as an optional 
            benefit.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Robust online services: Employers with Sun Life Dental have access to Sun Life Connect, our user-
            friendly portal for online plan administration. Employees have access to 
            www.sunlifedentalbenefits.com, an intuitive site where employees can go to view explanation of 
            benefits, find a dentist, learn about dental insurance, read about dental health, and more.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Great service, guaranteed: We are dedicated to providing our customers with prompt, responsive 
            customer service. To prove it, we offer a money-back service guarantee that covers the speed and 
            accuracy of claims processing and how quickly we respond to customer inquiries. 
         </p>
         <p>*Product offerings may not be available in all states and may vary depending on state laws and regulations.</p>
         <p>**The network is made available through an agreement with United Concordia Companies, Inc. Claims administration services are </p>

            This plan makes regular dental checkups easy by not counting Type I expenses toward the annual plan 
            maximum. This leaves more coverage for employees and their covered dependents when they need it 
            most, encouraging employees to maintain good oral health with routine care.

         <p>&#159; A minimum of 10 employees is required at point of sale.  If the enrollment of this group drops below 10

         <p>&#159; Sun Life is assumed to be the sole provider of dental insurance to the employer named in this proposal. </p>
         <p>&#159; Sun Life requires a final census, which includes participation information for contributory/voluntary 
            benefits, before the point of sale and reserves the right to re-rate the proposal upon verification of 
            dates of birth, genders, salaries, individual benefit elections, and occupations.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; If post-enrollment review shows that the group did not meet all of the underwriting requirements, we 
            reserve the right to re-rate retroactive to the effective date or terminate the contract.

         <p>&#159; This quote is provided based upon information provided with the proposal request.  It is intended for 
            informational purposes and is not an offer to contract.  The Employer may apply for the group dental 
            insurance shown in this proposal.  If the application is accepted by Sun Life, the final rates and benefits 
            will be based on the enrollment census and the verification of the information provided with the rate 
            request.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Rates assume the group does not currently have dental coverage with Sun Life Financial. However, if the 
            group is currently covered under a Sun Life Financial plan, the rates quoted in this proposal are not valid, 
            and the renewal rates will apply instead. Please contact your Sun Life Financial representative for more 
            information about your renewal rates.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; This proposal will be void if the inforce carrier is United Concordia or Assurant.</p>

            these circumstances may include suicide, and for AD&amp;D insurance, subject to state variations, they may 
            include intentionally self-inflicted injuries, war, active participation in a riot, committing or attempting to 
            commit a criminal act, injury sustained from any aviation activities (other than riding as a fare-paying 
            passenger), bodily or mental infirmity or disease of any kind, infection unless due to an accidental cut or 
            wound, voluntary use of any controlled substance, or operation of any motorized vehicle while

         <p>The group policy, which is described in this proposal, may include limitations and exclusions. </p>
         <p>Limitations may limit the amount of benefits payable or exclude benefits under certain circumstances. 
            These circumstances may include any period the employee is not under the regular and continuing care of 
            a physician providing appropriate treatment by means of examination and testing in accordance with the 
            disabling condition, or any period during which the employee fails to submit to a medical examination as 
            requested by Sun Life.
         </p>
         <p>Exclusions may prevent any benefits from being payable based on certain circumstances.  These 
            circumstances may include disabilities arising from self-inflicted injuries, war, active participation in a riot, 
            committing or attempting to commit a criminal act, work-related injuries or illnesses, or a pre-existing 
            condition. 
         </p>
         <p>(A pre-existing condition is defined as a condition for which, during the look back period prior to the 
            employee&rsquo;s effective date of insurance or in some cases the effective date of an increase in coverage, the 
            employee received medical treatment, consultation, care, or services, including diagnostic measures, or

            insurance or in some cases the effective date of an increase in coverage, the employee received medical 
            treatment, consultation, care, or services, including diagnostic measures, or took prescribed drugs or

            group of companies, is not an insurance company and does not guarantee the obligations of these
