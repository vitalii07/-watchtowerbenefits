         <p>Things to know</p>
         <p>&#159; This proposal shows a summary of proposed benefits, rates, and underlying assumptions. It is not part of 
            the group policy or a legal contract with Sun Life Financial or its affiliated companies.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; This proposal is valid for 60 days, starting from October 30, 2014, and only for the proposed Effective 
            Date. 
         </p>
         <p>&#159; This proposal is for fully insured, nonparticipating coverage that terminates at retirement, unless 
            otherwise noted.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; The rates shown may be subject to recalculation pending a) final enrollment, b) census data, and c) 
            review of any additional data requested in the proposal. Please review the assumptions for information 
            about how the rates were derived.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; We require that you provide a copy of the current carrier&rsquo;s policy or certificate at time of sale.</p>

         <p>Producer licensing</p>
         <p>All Sun Life Financial companies require producers who use insurance quotes for the purpose of soliciting, 
            selling or negotiating insurance to be licensed both by the state where the prospective client is located 
            and by any state where the solicitation, sale, or negotiation of insurance occurs, if different. This 
            requirement pertains to all forms of solicitation, sale, or negotiation of insurance, including but not limited 
            to solicitation, sale, or negotiation conducted in person, or by telephone, by e-mail, by fax, or otherwise.
         </p>
         <p>Producer compensation</p>
         <p>We encourage brokers and their clients to discuss what commission or other compensation may be paid in 
            connection with the purchase of products and services from Sun Life companies. All Sun Life Financial 
            companies may pay the selling broker, agency, or third party administrator for the promotion, sale, and 
            renewal of the products and services offered in this proposal. In addition to our standard compensation 
            arrangements, we may make additional cash payments or reimbursements to selling brokers in recognition 
            of their marketing and distribution activities, persistency levels, and volume of business. For New York&ndash;
            issued cases, producers must comply with the specific compensation disclosure requirements of New York 
            Regulation 194.
         </p>
         <p>Plan and rates</p>
         <p>This proposal may be based on employee census information provided by the employer. Acceptance of the 
            group and final rates will be determined by Sun Life based on actual enrollment and case experience, if 
            required. Terms and conditions of any coverage under the policy may be determined by all required final 
            data and by underwriting rules, minimum participation requirements, and policy provisions in effect on the 
            date coverage begins.
         </p>
         <p>Underwriting companies</p>
         <p>The Sun Life Financial group of companies operates under the Sun Life Financial name. In the United States 
            and elsewhere, insurance products are offered by members of the Sun Life Financial group that are 
            insurance companies. Sun Life Financial Inc., the publicly traded holding company for the Sun Life Financial 
            group of companies, is not an insurance company and does not guarantee the obligations of these 
            insurance companies. Each insurance company relies on its own financial strength and claims-paying ability.

         <p>SLPC 20013 rev. 06090613  GGOT-1288</p>
         <p>Basic Life</p>
         <p>We are pleased to offer Basic Life insurance to employers, with the benefits employees want. Here are 
            some highlights:
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Value-Added Services: Employers with noncontributory coverage can choose the Value-Added 
            Services package that best fits the needs of their employees. These noninsurance services are 
            included in the price of your Basic Life coverage.
         </p>
         <p>&ndash; Choice #1: Emergency Travel Assistance for employees and dependents traveling 100+ miles 
            from home, and Identity Theft Protection for employees. Services provided by Assist
            America.4
         </p>
         <p>&ndash; Choice #2: Online Will Preparation for employees and spouses, and Claimant Support 
            Services for claimants and families who need professional grief, legal, or financial 
            counseling. Services are provided over the telephone by ComPsych&reg;.4
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Accelerated Benefits: Terminally ill employees may access a portion of their death benefit while 
            they are alive. 
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Waiver of Premium: Waiver benefits protect employees who are Totally Disabled, as defined by the 
            policy, and who meet age requirements. Employers can customize the elimination period or choose 
            no elimination period&mdash;a popular choice because it means easy tracking and immediate benefits for 
            eligible employees.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Claims Settlement: Beneficiaries may elect to receive either a complimentary interest-bearing 
            account or a lump-sum payment. Availability and coverage may vary by state.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Accidental Death &amp; Dismemberment (AD&amp;D): Protection for covered Accidental Death and covered 
            injuries such as Speech/Hearing, Loss of Limb, Loss of Use of a Limb Due to Quadriplegia, Paraplegia, 
            or Hemiplegia, and Thumb and Index finger&mdash;all with a standard 365-day loss period. Many optional 
            riders can be added, including Seat Belt, Air Bag, Helmet, Business Travel, Bereavement Counseling, 
            and Child and/or Spouse Education.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Voluntary benefits: Attractive programs provide the coverage employees want, with simple, flexible 
            plan designs and hassle-free enrollments.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Portability: In states that allow portability, groups receive it as a standard feature. So, when 
            coverage ends for reasons other than sickness, injury, retirement, or termination of the employer&rsquo;s 
            plan, employees can apply for a portable Term Life policy without Evidence of Insurability. 
            Availability may vary by state.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Continuation: Groups in states where Portability is not available may elect Continuation at point of 
            sale. Continuation allows employees, when their coverage ends, to continue their Group Term 
            coverage without Evidence of Insurability. They can continue this coverage as long as the group 
            policy is in force. This coverage is in addition to any state-mandated Continuation benefits.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Service Guarantees: We are pleased to offer a Life Service Guarantee, which covers the speed and 
            accuracy of our claims processing as well as how quickly we respond to our customers&rsquo; phone calls. 
            In addition, we include an overall satisfaction guarantee to ensure that our customers are 100% 
            satisfied with our service. These service guarantees are available to all 100% employer-paid and 
            partially employer-paid plans.

            There could be income tax and ERISA implications when the employer-funded Basic Life rates are subsidized by employee-funded Optional Life 
            rates. Subsidized rates may create additional imputed income for some employees (under IRC Section 79) and may implicate ERISA's fiduciary 
            rules. You should review these issues with your tax and ERISA counsel before implementing a subsidized group basic and optional life plan.

         <p>Optional Life
            We are pleased to offer Optional Life insurance with no-hassle administration. Here are some highlights:
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Accelerated Benefits: Terminally ill employees may access a portion of their death benefit while

            eligible employees.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Claims Settlement: Beneficiaries may elect to receive either a complimentary interest-bearing 
            account or a lump-sum payment. Availability and coverage may vary by state.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Accidental Death &amp; Dismemberment (AD&amp;D): Protection for covered Accidental Death and covered 
            injuries such as Speech/Hearing, Loss of Limb, Loss of Use of a Limb Due to Quadriplegia, Paraplegia, 
            or Hemiplegia, and Thumb and Index Finger&mdash;all with a standard 365-day loss period. Many optional 
            riders can be added, including Seat Belt, Air Bag, Helmet, Business Travel, Bereavement Counseling, 
            and Child and/or Spouse Education.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Voluntary benefits: Attractive programs provide the coverage employees want, with simple, flexible 
            plan designs and hassle-free enrollments.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Portability: In states that allow Portability, groups receive it as a standard feature. So, when coverage 
            ends for reasons other than sickness, injury, retirement, or termination of the employer's plan, 
            employees can apply for a portable Term Life policy without Evidence of Insurability. Availability 
            may vary by state.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Continuation: Groups in states where Portability is not available may elect Continuation at point of 
            sale. Continuation allows employees, when their coverage ends, to continue their Group Term 
            coverage without Evidence of Insurability. They can continue this coverage as long as the group 
            policy is in force. This coverage is in addition to any state-mandated Continuation benefits.

         <p>&#159; Standard Sun Life Financial policy language is offered, including coverage options for leave of absence, 
            layoff, or termination.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; An employee must be Actively at Work on his/her effective date for coverage to become effective. If 
            an employee is not Actively at Work on his or her effective date, coverage will not become effective 
            until the employee is again Actively at Work.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; If the minimum participation is not met, the Guaranteed Issue amount, policy provisions, and rates are 
            subject to change.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Optional Life is available only when a Basic Life plan is written by Sun Life Financial and when no other
            contributory, employer-sponsored life plans are offered.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Dependents are eligible for coverage only when the employee is enrolled in Employee Optional Life. 
            Dependent coverage amounts are subject to state requirements.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Coverage for dependents who are hospital-confined due to illness or injury will be effective on the date 
            they are no longer hospital-confined. Hospital-confined does not apply to a newborn child.

         <p>&#159; Receipt of a copy of the prior carrier&rsquo;s policy or certificate at the point of sale.</p>
         <p>&#159; Sun Life requires a final census before the point of sale and reserves the right to re-rate the proposal

            Evidence of Insurability except when the new coverage amount exceeds the Guaranteed Issue amount

         <p>Short-Term Disability
            We are pleased to offer income replacement coverage with flexible plan designs and Return-to-Work 
            incentives to help employers manage costs. Here are some highlights:
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Flexible and fully insured plan designs: Employers appreciate our flexible Short-Term Disability plan 
            designs, which all include an "own occupation" definition and full maternity coverage. Employers 
            may select from a variety of options: W-2 preparation at no additional cost, employer FICA match, 
            varied benefit durations, and length of elimination periods. 
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Expert claims management: Using a team approach, medical, psychiatric, and vocational 
            professionals actively manage Short-Term Disability claims. Employers who buy both Short-Term 
            Disability and Long-Term Disability can take full advantage of our innovative early intervention 
            process and personalized Return-to-Work plans.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Tiered benefits: Employers can vary benefits payments over the duration of an employee&rsquo;s disability. </p>
         <p>&#159; Statutory plans: We offer statutory plans in New York, New Jersey, and Hawaii.</p>
         <p>&#159; Residual Disability Benefits: This option allows employees to satisfy the Elimination Period by 
            combining days of Total and Partial Disability.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Partial Disability Benefits: This option allows employees to receive up to 100% of their pre-
            disability earnings when working part-time, giving them extra motivation to get back to work as 
            quickly as possible.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Survivor Benefit: This option allows a survivor benefit to be payable in a lump sum to a surviving 
            spouse or eligible child, if an employee dies before the benefit duration ends, was disabled for at 
            least 14 consecutive days, and was eligible to receive Short-Term Disability benefits prior to death.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; First-Day Hospitalization: This option helps protect hospitalized employees by providing immediate 
            benefits with no Elimination Period.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Service Guarantees: We are pleased to offer a Short-Term Disability Service Guarantee which covers 
            the speed and accuracy of our claims processing as well as how quickly we respond to our 
            customers&rsquo; phone calls. In addition, we include an overall satisfaction guarantee to ensure that our 
            customers are 100% satisfied with our service. These service guarantees are available to all 100% 
            employer-paid and partially employer-paid plans.

         <p>Long-Term Disability
            Assumptions
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Standard Sun Life Financial contractual language is offered, including coverage for leave of absence, 
            layoff or termination.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; An employee must be Actively at Work on his/her effective date for coverage to become effective. If 
            an employee is not Actively at Work on his or her effective date, coverage will not become effective 
            until the employee is again Actively at Work.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Definition of Total Disability: If an employee is unable to perform the material and substantial duties of 
            the employee's own occupation, he or she is considered disabled. When the Own Occupation Period is 
            completed, an employee is still considered disabled when unable to perform the material and 
            substantial duties of any occupation for which he or she is reasonably qualified by education, training, or 
            experience.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Employees in states with statutory STD plans are covered by those statutory plans and that any LTD 
            benefit payable will be offset by those statutory benefits. We reserve the right to re-rate if this 
            assumption proves incorrect.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Sun Life requires a final census before the point of sale and reserves the right to re-rate the proposal 
            upon verification of dates of birth, genders, salaries, and occupations.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Receipt of a copy of the prior carrier's policy or certificate at the point of sale.</p>
         <p>&#159; Common ownership of the business units.</p>
         <p>&#159; Notification of any employer-completed merger or acquisition.</p>
         <p>&#159; All noncontributory plan designs assume the employer pays the entire premium and that all benefits are
            fully taxable.
         </p>
         <p>&#159; Temporary, leased, contracted (1099), and seasonal employees are not eligible to participate.</p>

            group of companies, is not an insurance company and does not guarantee the obligations of these 
            insurance companies. Each insurance company relies on its own financial strength and claims-paying ability.
